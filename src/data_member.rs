/// This module provides functions for modifying the memory of a program from outside of the
/// address space of that program.
///
/// Examples:
/// ```rust
/// # use process_memory::{Memory, DataMember, Pid, TryIntoProcessHandle};
/// // We have a variable with some value
/// let x = 4u32;
/// println!("Original x-value: {}", x);
///
/// // We need to make sure that we get a handle to a process, in this case, ourselves
/// let handle = (std::process::id() as Pid).try_into_process_handle().unwrap();
/// // We make a `DataMember` that has an offset referring to its location in memory
/// let member = DataMember::new_offset(handle, vec![&x as *const _ as usize]);
/// // The memory refered to is now the same
/// println!("Memory location: &x: {}, member: {}", &x as *const _ as usize,
///     member.get_offset().unwrap());
/// assert_eq!(&x as *const _ as usize, member.get_offset().unwrap());
/// // The value of the member is the same as the variable
/// println!("Member value: {}", unsafe { member.read().unwrap() });
/// assert_eq!(x, unsafe { member.read().unwrap() });
/// // We can write to and modify the value of the variable using the member
/// member.write(&6u32).unwrap();
/// println!("New x-value: {}", x);
/// assert_eq!(x, 6u32);
